# Reproducible Data Analysis: Standard Repository Structure

## Introduction
On December 7th, 2023, a session on Reproducible Data Analysis was led by Elaine and Ellie, driving us to rethink our approach to data science. This repository is a direct outcome of that meeting, designed as a practical example to illustrate the structure of a standard repository for reproducible data analysis.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a model or guide, showcasing how to effectively organize a data analysis project to enhance reproducibility. The strategies and structures outlined here are vital for ensuring that our data analysis is transparent, well-documented, and easily replicable by others.

## Repository Structure
While repository structures can vary depending on their specific purposes and requirements, this repository aims to provide a general framework that can be adapted to different projects. It includes directories and files arranged in a way that exemplifies best practices in organizing data, code, documentation, and results.

### Key Components:
- **Raw Data Directory:** Contains raw data files. These should be set as **read only** to avoid overwriting. 
- **Processed Data Directory:** This contains processed data files. This separation of raw and processed data ensures clarity in data handling and transformation processes.
- **Scripts Directory:** Holds all the code used for data processing and analysis. Scripts are named and organized logically for ease of navigation.
- **Figures/Output:** Features outputs such as tables, figures, and any other relevant results. This area is crucial for reviewing and presenting the outcomes of the analysis.

## Accessing the Presentation
For a comprehensive understanding, please refer to the slides accessible through this link: [Reproducible Data Analysis by Ed](https://www.mentimeter.com/app/presentation/alyfyzphahmeghsh8rekacjr7h8qsimy/zeikuwv5fszx).

## Conclusion
This repository is a step toward fostering a culture of reproducibility in our data analysis practices. By following these structured guidelines, we aim to achieve higher standards of clarity, efficiency, and reliability in our research.
